\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Introduction}
%/////////

\begin{block}{Cyber-Physical Swarms (CPSW)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A myriad devices that \emph{interact} with the environment and \emph{exchange} information 
			among themselves;
		%\item Focus on properties like self-organization %\cite{schmeck2011organic}
		%	 and collective intelligence;%\cite{tumer2004survey};
		\item A wide range of applied domains, including: smart cities \cite{zedadra2019swarm}, 
			swarm robotics \cite{brambilla2013swarm}, 
			large-scale IoT systems \cite{uslu2023role}, and more.
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{alertblock}{Engineering approaches}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Macro-programming: manually developing controllers 
			from a global perspective (e.g., \emph{Aggregate Computing} \cite {viroli2018field});
		\item AI: learn directly from experience and/or data 
			(e.g., \emph{Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning} \cite{4445757} and 
			\emph{Graph Neural Networks} \cite{9046288});
		\item Open space for \emph{hybrid approaches}.
	\end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Aggregate computing}
%/////////
\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{0.55\textwidth}
	\begin{block}{Overview}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \emph{Computational fields} \cite{mamei2004cofields, viroli2019distributed} as first-class abstractions;
			\item Programs as field transformations through \emph{field calculus} \cite{viroli2016higher}.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.45\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ac.png}
\end{column}
\end{columns}

\centering
\begin{alertblock}{Computational model}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Each node shares the same \emph{aggregate program};
	\item Each node execute rounds iteratively and asynchronously:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Sense}: collect information from the neighborhood and sensors;
		\item \textbf{Compute}: execute the aggregate program on the context;
		\item \textbf{Act}: share the export with the neighborhood.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}

\begin{alertblock}{Advantages}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Programs defined in a \emph{composable} and \emph{declarative} manner;
		\item Promotes the \emph{reuse} of behaviours;
		\item Low-level aspects (e.g., failures) are \emph{automatically handled} by the middleware;
		\item A reliable and efficient Scala implementation: \emph{ScaFi} \cite{casadei2022scafi}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A \emph{domain specific language (DSL)} for specifying aggregate computation;
			\item A \emph{simulation environment}, through the Alchemist simulator \cite{alchemist};
			\item A \emph{middleware} for executing and deploying aggregate programs;
			\item Reusable \emph{library functionalities} that serve as building blocks for constructing new aggregate
			programs (e.g., Gradients).
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Learning from experience}
%/////////
\begin{block}{Reinforcement learning}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item An \emph{agent} interacts with an \emph{environment} through \emph{actions};
		\item The environment provides a feedback signal (i.e., the \emph{reward});
		\item Agent goal: learn the optimal \emph{policy} to maximize some long-run measure of reinforcement.
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{img/rl.png}

\begin{alertblock}{Algorithms}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Value-based}: aim to learn a value function that evaluates the goodness of each possible action from every 
				state in the environment (e.g., \emph{Q-Learning} \cite{dayan1992q}, \emph{DQN} \cite{mnih2013playing});
		\item \textbf{Policy-based}: aim to directly learn a behavioural policy (i.e., a state-action mapping) without
			utilizing an intermediate value function (e.g., \emph{Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)} \cite{schulman2017proximal}).
	\end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}

\begin{alertblock}{Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Extension of classic RL to multi-agent systems;
		\item Very promising field, but it introduces several challenges that need to be addressed, for example:
			 non-stationarity and equilibrium among the various policies.
	\end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}

\begin{alertblock}{Training mode}
	Based on information available to agents during training and execution phases we can classify 
		MARL algorithms into three families:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Centralized Training and Centralized Execution (CTCE);
		\item Decentralized Training and Decentralized Execution (DTDE);
		\item Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE).
	\end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}

\begin{alertblock}{Tasks}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Cooperative}: agents cooperate to maximize a global reward (we focus on this);
		\item Competitive: agents compete to maximize their own reward;
		\item Mixed: agents cooperate and compete at the same time.
	\end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Graph Neural Networks}
%/////////

\begin{block}{Why}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Nowdays data represented as \emph{graphs} are ubiquitous 
			(e.g., social networks, molecules in chemistry, etc.);
		\item \emph{Computational fields} can also be seen as graphs;
		\item This model can be \emph{distributed} across various nodes and applied to each of them, 
			as it only applies local transformations.
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{columns}
	\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
		\begin{alertblock}{Many types of tasks}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Node classification/regression;
				\item Edge classification/regression;
				\item Graph classification/regression;
				\item Node embeddings;
			\end{itemize}
		\end{alertblock}
	\end{column}
	\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/gnn.png}
	\end{column}
\end{columns}


\begin{alertblock}{Computational model}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item There exists multiple variants of GNNs, but they all share the same basic structure composed of two phases;
		\item \textbf{Aggregate}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Aggregation of information from neighbours;
			\item Usually, it is a simple function that performs a graph convolution on the neighbours;
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Combine}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Combination of the aggregated information with the information present in the 
				node at the previous time step;
			\item Usually, it is a a differentiable complex function, such as a layer of a neural network.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Project description}

\begin{block}{Problems}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item CPSW \emph{coordination} to perform complex tasks, manually developing controllers 
			has some drawbacks:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It is highly challenging to write satisfactory and efficient programs;
			\item Programs may be error-prone;
			\item Programs may lack of generality;
		\end{itemize}
		\item AI approaches also present challenges, for example:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Non-stationarity;
			\item Communication;
			\item Scalability.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}
	
\begin{alertblock}{Proposed approach}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{Hybrid approach}: combination of aggregate computing and AI;
		\item Achieve a \emph{toolchain} that enables agile development and prototyping of these systems;
		\item Advantages:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Reducing the complexity of learning;
			\item Improving the adaptability of proposed solutions;
			\item Guiding the learning of complex behaviours in a simpler way through the use of 
				computational fields.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}

\end{frame}
%/////////

%/////////
\begin{frame}[c]{Activities}

\begin{block}{Necessary steps}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Define how \emph{learning of behaviours} can be pursued for CPSWs. 
			Two main possible approaches:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Using aggregate computing to encode the information that will then be 
					passed to machine learning algorithms;
				\item Using machine learning to generate portions of aggregated programs;
			\end{itemize}
		\item Development of the \emph{toolchain} (already started with \emph{Scarlib} \cite{scarlib});
		\item \emph{Benchmark}: selection of well-known examples from the state-of-the-art (e.g., flocking) 
			that will be used to evaluate the performance and usability of the toolchain;
		\item Opportunistic \emph{deployment}.
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}
	
\end{frame}
%/////////

%/////////
\begin{frame}[c]{Scope}

\begin{block}{Scope}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{Distributed AI}: integration with CPSW will bring forth several challenges that contribute
		to this field, for example:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Continuous learning: ensure that agents can not only learn during the initial phase but also
				refine their knowledge online once they have been deployed;
		\end{itemize}
		\item \emph{Swarm robotics}: automatic design of controllers for swarm of robots;
		\item \emph{Software engineering}: development of novel models, 
			design techniques, languages, and algorithms that can be utilized to
			effectively handle the complexity of CPSW.
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}
